Every Class ends with an assignment task.

Step 1:
    create a repository and clone the repository to your local machine.

Step 2:
    - create a virtual environment ( see "Study Materials/Git Command Execution.txt")
    - Login to your virtualenv
    - install your requirements
        $ pip install -r requirements.txt
        you need to repeat the step when ever u add new libraries to the file.
        makesure you add the versions also. 
    - build for your code
    - git add, git commit and push your changes ( see "Study Materials/Git Command Execution.txt")
    - verify your changes are appearing in the git.
Step 3:
    you will be given 5 days to work on assignments and your teachers will verify the codes.

Mandate Day 1
*******************
    You can check the basic template from sample projects created for your understanding. 
    you need to create 2 folders, one for datageneration ( which will be used only for verification) and another one is for code.
    
    Batch <number> Serial <number>
    - serial number is the assignment to be created
    - your code should run on port defined as below
        8<batchnumber><serialnumber>
        eg, if you are batch 3 serial 2, you code will run on 8301
            if you are batch 4 serial 10, you code will run on 8410

    Acceptance:
        1. run application without errors on given port 
        2. make it as a docker container and run the applica
